# 🖼️ Image Processing & Augmentation with OpenCV and Keras

This project demonstrates simple image processing techniques using OpenCV and image augmentation using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`. Designed for beginners working in **Google Colab**, it provides a hands-on walkthrough of loading, modifying, annotating, and augmenting images.

## 📌 Features

- Upload and display images using Google Colab
- Convert images to grayscale
- Resize and preview images
- Annotate images with rectangles and text
- Save processed images
- Perform basic image augmentation (rotation)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab environment

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload an image** when prompted.
2. **View transformations** applied:
   - Original and grayscale display
   - Resized previews
   - Annotation with rectangle and text
3. **Save output** image as `output_img.jpg`.
4. **Upload another image** for augmentation.
5. **View augmented samples** using Keras `ImageDataGenerator`.

## 🖼️ Example Output

- `output_img.jpg` – your annotated image
- Augmented samples – a few rotated variations of your uploaded image

## 🧠 Learnings

This notebook is ideal for:

- Understanding the basics of OpenCV
- Performing preprocessing for computer vision tasks
- Learning about data augmentation for deep learning
